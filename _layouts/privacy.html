<p>This notice (available at <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">https://openzeppelin.com/</a>) and any other documents referred to in it sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

<h2>Automated decision-making</h2>
<p>We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated processing of Personal Data, unless we have considered the proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that it meets the requirements of EU data protection legislation and other applicable laws.</p>
